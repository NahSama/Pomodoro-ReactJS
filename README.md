## Pomodoro using ReactJS

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This application allows user to adjust the session length, break length and select available ringtone when the timer finishes.
